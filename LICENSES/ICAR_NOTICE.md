# ICAR usage notice

This project uses items inspired by the International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR).
ICAR provides **public‑domain** cognitive ability items and sample tests intended for
research and educational use. See: https://icar-project.com/ and https://icar-project.org/

Notes:
- Do **not** use Raven's Progressive Matrices content (licensed by Pearson) unless you
  have permission. Use only public‑domain ICAR items or items you generate yourself.
- See the included `data/icar16.ts` for a scaffold. Replace placeholder items with
  genuine ICAR items you are permitted to use (public‑domain).
