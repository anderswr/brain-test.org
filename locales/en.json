Each correct answer contributes to a weighted z-score that is scaled to the population mean (μ = 100, σ = 15). The 95% confidence interval (CI) reflects normal statistical variation based on test length.",

  "about-title": "About this test",
  "about-method": "This test uses a balanced mix of open-format cognitive tasks modeled after well-established reasoning and aptitude assessments. It estimates general reasoning ability (g) in a transparent and research-oriented way.",
  "about-audience": "Suitable for ages 14 and up. Designed for education, personal insight, or preliminary aptitude screening. No personal data is collected — only an anonymous ID is stored for comparison over time.",
  "about-limitations": "Results are approximate and can vary with factors such as focus, language, and environment. This tool is educational and not a substitute for a formal psychological evaluation.",
  "iq_explainer-title": "How your IQ estimate is calculated",
  "iq_explainer-intro": "This assessment uses a research-based method to estimate general cognitive ability (g). It combines multiple domains to produce a standardized IQ-like score for educational and self-reflection purposes.",
  "iq_explainer-method-heading": "Calculation method",
  "iq_explainer-method-p1": "Each correct answer contributes to your raw accuracy. Scores are weighted across five domains: Reasoning, Math, Verbal, Spatial, and Memory.",
  "iq_explainer-method-p2": "Your total is converted into a standardized score using a z-score transformation, then scaled to an IQ-equivalent metric (mean = 100, SD = 15).",
  "iq_explainer-method-p3": "A 95% confidence interval (CI) indicates expected variation based on the number of questions and category balance.",
  "iq_explainer-theory-heading": "Psychometric background",
  "iq_explainer-theory-p1": "The scoring model follows classical test theory (CTT) principles and psychometric scaling used in validated aptitude and intelligence measures.",
  "iq_explainer-theory-p2": "It reflects conventions used in instruments such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV) and Raven’s Progressive Matrices, adjusted for open-source testing contexts.",

  "iq_explainer-audience-heading": "Intended use",
  "iq_explainer-audience-p1": "This test provides a general, research-style IQ estimate that can be used for self-assessment, education, or personal development.",
  "iq_explainer-audience-p2": "It does not define intelligence but provides a snapshot of cognitive processing and reasoning efficiency.",
  "iq_explainer-limitations-heading": "Interpretation and limitations",
  "iq_explainer-limitations-p1": "Results depend on focus, motivation, and familiarity with similar problem types. Re-taking the test may slightly improve scores due to practice effects.",

  "iq_explainer-summary": "In short: this test provides a transparent, research-inspired estimate of general cognitive ability — standardized to the IQ scale (mean 100, SD 15) for intuitive interpretation."
